1. MIT's Materiable - The project involves a set of rectangular pins, flat along the top, that are used to simulate different fluid and material dynamics (such as how viscous or elastic a material might be). In one example, by pushing on a certain area of the pins, the pins then radiate waves from that point outward as if mimicking water. I like the project since it's a way to emulate that fluidity, which can help us understand how that works mathematically. To reproduce something like this, I believe you'd need a great deal of programming, and an understanding of fluid dynamics/mechanics; also, the materials required.

2. Thijs Rijkers' Suicide Machine - A particularly weird project, one that I picked based on the name. Consists of a Gearbox that slowly pours sand within its gears to wear them out. I feel like it's a statement towards the fallibility of machines using mechanical parts; it brings up an important point, how machines can break down at one point and won't work forever. To create a similar project you'd need a similar machine that runs using gears or cogs, and a method to disperse water or dust into it to cause damage. Link here: https://vimeo.com/77012997

3. M2A: The Fantastic Voyage - A pill that is electronically modified to record video as it passes through the body, mainly for the intestinal tracts. I believe this is very useful for determining how the body reacts to different kinds of food (or in the case of the video, processed vs whole food), but can find use in general diagnosis without requiring invasive surgery. I would like to see a product like this being used, but would be concerned with whether the pill can last through the gastric juices and through the body. To reproduce, you'd need a small enough camera to fit inside a pill, as well as the battery, connections and storage for video. It looks like you can do that with what technology there is, but for us to reproduce I'm not sure. Link here: http://www.stefanibardin.net/m2a-the-fantastic-voyage/
